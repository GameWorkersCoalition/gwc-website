          <h2>About the GWC</h2>
          <p>
            The Game Workers Coalition is a communication network for worker-led
            labour organizations and unions in the games industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2017 we have seen an enormous upswell in organizing in the
            games industry, from a growth of interest in and support for
            unionization to walkouts, strikes, and the foundation of new unions
            all around the world, in studios of all sizes. As the historically
            international games industry increasingly operates across borders
            through mergers and acquisitions and the gradual adoption of remote
            work, the purpose of the GWC is to coordinate between local games
            labour organizations to facilitate cooperation in our efforts to
            improve working conditions and build worker power in our industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Game Workers Coalition was formed by several labour
            organizations across the world, as a decentralized network in the
            spirit of international solidarity. Please contact the member
            organizations directly if you’d like to get in touch.

            There are many other games labour organisations worldwide who may
            not be members of the GWC yet. If you are looking to join an
            organisation in your local area and have not been able to locate
            them, one of the organisations listed here may be able to assist.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you represent an organization that is interested in joining the
            GWC, please reach out to any of the orgs in this list to ask about
            becoming a GWC member.
